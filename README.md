# Course Management application

## Intro

This is a hobby application originally made for my personal use. As a university student I know some students don't like
platforms offered by their university, since those platforms are complex and have alot more functionalities.
So I decided to make my own application to keep track of my school progress. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible while maintaining the basic functionalities. Here are some of the actions a user can do in this app:

- See all their currently active courses, completed courses and planned ones
- Add course
- Remove course
- Mark ongoing course as completed and provide result
- Start a planned course
- Change their profile picture
- Download their data in json format
- See cool stats about their progress

The main purpose of making this app is however learning. I had heard of how loved framework is Vue among web-developers, so I decided to learn it and see if it deserves all the hype. I soon realized that it deserves it all.
